          </summary>
        </header>
        <details>
          <P>Well I introduce myself my name is: Roberth Rondón I was born in Caracas - Venezuela, but living in
            Barranquilla - Colimbia since 2018. I came to Colombia with a lot of desire to work, but I did not find
            a job in the four initials months. So I had to work for a delivery company for almost two years on a
            bicycle.
            Until I decided that I had to go back to work, with something I liked, computers. I have 9 years of
            experience
            in a telecommunications company, which opened my mind and heart for technology. </p>

          <h4>My reasons</h4>
          <p>I am motivated by my six year old daughter, she moves my world and has given me a much broader outward
            vision
            about goals I want to achieve and the example I want to transmit to her that everything is possible for the
            one
            who believes in his heart that he can achieve what he sets out to achieve, if it is a genuine, authentic
            goal
            and that goes according to your beliefs, such as being a software engineer, doctor, firefighter or singer.
            "Everything is possible for the one who believes"(Marcos, 9:22)</p>
          <p>The first thing we must understand is that we do the things we like and if you do a job you like, you are
            not
            really working, you are having fun, you are learning and you are fulfilling yourself as a person and a human
            being.</p>
          <p>The most important thing too, is to do it for you, if you do it for someone else, like for my daughter for
            example, that's fine, but doing it for you, because it's your dream, it's what you want to achieve, it keeps
            you
            driven and eager to make it happen. It's super important to be identified with your goal.
          </p>

          <h4>Before</h4>
          <p>I was working as a domiciliary in cycling. At first I liked it because it was an independent job and I was
            successful in supporting myself for two years, but I was not achieving my goals, so I needed something else.
          </p>

          <p> The most difficult part of this job was to stay healthy, riding 50 km a day at my age of 48, it is very
            hard.
          </p>

          <p>Before that, I also started a multilevel marketing company where I worked for about five years. In this
            company
            I learned many positive things about personal motivation, sales and human relations, very good experience.
          </p>

          <p>Before starting my own business I was an employee for 9 years in the company that gave me the opportunity
            to
            work with technology. Here I had a professional career, I felt fulfilled in all aspects, I started as a
            technician and ended as a specialist. I learned about telecommunications hardware and software and other
            things
            that helped me to perform as a telecommunications professional.</p>
          </p>

          <h4>Work Project</h4>
          <p>When I worked in telecommunications 3 of the 9 years were in a statistics department, where I learned to
            program with a language called Visual Basic 6.0 or Visual Basic for applications, it is Microsoft
            technology.
            I
            was part of a development team where I learned everything about computers, my colleagues at that time,
            uncovered
            a computer for me, I did not know how they were inside and they were explaining me all about the hardware
            that
            was there inside, parts like the hard drive, ram memory, motherboard, microprocessor, etc.</p>

          <p>I remember all these things as if they were yesterday. I learned how a bit is transmitted up to Megabytes,
            terms
            like TCP/IP, ATM, Frame Relay, Routers, Switches, Nodes, etc were as if they were talking to me in Mandarin
            Chinese, because I didn't know what they were.</p>

          <p>From the software point of view, I learned some things like routines, programs, cycles, desktop
            applications,
            servers, etc. I was really enriched from the software point of view.</p>

          <p>I was really enriched by all this technology at my fingertips. And so I learned how to create software and
            how
            to maintain it. Also to make it better and better and get to the point of being efficient and effective in
            my
            work.</p>

          <p>The project was about telecommunications statistics, which had to be calculated and compared with the goals
            foreseen in the service level agreements (SLA). In addition to uploading them to the company's intranet so
            that
            everyone involved could take advantage of the value that this information represented.
          </p>
          <h4>I am a Software Engineer</h4>
          <p>I put my hands to work in 2020 I began to develop software independently and to study new things about the
            techniques and technologies that are currently used, reviewing all the subject of writing software, starting
            with C language, since it is the type of language, from which many of the new technologies were born, such
            as:
            C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, etc..</p>
          <p>Recently I have been working with Linux Scripting, C Language, and Oracle Databases, it has been a good
            experience, I learned a lot about how to program with Bash in Linux, use C functions in that environment
            when
            required and connect with Oracle databases. However, I am still studying JavaScript, as that is the
            programming
            language I like and with it you can do a lot of things both on the frontend and backend side. My favorite
            technologies with JavaScript are: NodeJS, Express (I recently discovered Nest Js) Angular, React.</p>

          <p>But currently I went back to Microsoft .Net technologies, such as ASP.NET, C#, Vb.NET, MsSql Server, due to
            my
            new job as a full stack programmer. The truth is that it has been a good decision to return to study and
            train
            as a software developer, because it has reopened the doors to the world of technology, in
            which there are currently many possibilities to develop a well-paid career.</p>

          <p>I continue to be motivated by my six-year-old daughter and my love for technology. It is a world that
            advances
            very fast, is constantly evolving, but is always updated, in short, my decision to stay in the technology
            sector
            is a fact and a blessing that my God has given me and which I want to develop honestly, authentically and
            professionally, the Lord give me many days of life to continue having the privilege of being part of the
            technology community in Colombia, Latin America and the rest of the world. Thank God always!</p>
